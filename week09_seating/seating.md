Given that the airlines have to profit from plane seating business, the economy plus members should get the first choices for their seats. However, after a certain seating capacity is reached, it should follow an algorithm that is unbiased. Ticket sales are either single or multiple. 
Instead of assigning random seats for the Economy members, it should check the passengerâ€™s last name to see if they purchased multiple tickets and the algorithm would allow family/groups to be seated together whenever possible. To combat any equity issues for single passengers, we suggest the following:


There are three types of seats being offered
	Economy (single passenger)
	Economy Plus (single passenger)
	Family or Groups (2 or greater passengers)
We are suggesting that the seats be allocated in the following fashion.
* First assign seats to people willing to pay a premium.
* Second Place the single economy and family seats in two groups.
* For these two groups we can alternate assigning seats.  For example, first assign a group of two or more a block of seats, and then select an individual economy passenger.
* Keep alternating back and forth until the seats have all been allocated
